# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

**I feel good about these as well for the same reasons.**

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

**I feel good about these as well. I've been working on building a side project (in javascript) that has a lot of these in them so I feel pretty good about this area.**

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

**About 1.5 hours. It was a little slower than I expected, but I did a good amount of work.**

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

**Nothing to adjust, this will be another part of my review process.**

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

**No questions. I had one, but was able to solve it myself by running my code on the code challenge exercise.**
